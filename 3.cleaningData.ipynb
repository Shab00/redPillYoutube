    "## The Importance of Cleaning YouTube Video Data\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with YouTube video data, proper cleaning is essential because:\n",
    "\n",
    " **Raw data contains inconsistencies**:\n",
    "   - Video titles may include special characters or emojis\n",
    "   - Descriptions often have promotional links or boilerplate text\n",
    "   - Metadata fields (like view counts or durations) might be formatted inconsistently\n",
    "\n",
    " **Missing or incomplete information**:\n",
    "   - Some videos may lack thumbnails or proper category tags\n",
    "   - Engagement metrics (likes/dislikes) could be unavailable for certain videos\n",
    "\n",
    " **Impact on analysis**:\n",
    "   - Unclean data can distort viewership trends and performance comparisons\n",
    "   - Machine learning models trained on raw data may produce unreliable predictions\n",
    "   - Business decisions based on uncleaned data could be misguided\n",
    "\n",
    "By systematically, standardizing text formats, handling missing values appropriately, removing duplicate entries and validating numerical metrics we can ensure the data accurately represents channel performance and viewer behavior. This cleaning process forms the foundation for all subsequent analysis, from basic reporting to advanced predictive modeling."

    "### Core Data Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "**pandas**: The primary library for working with structured data. It enables creating organized tables (DataFrames) from YouTube API responses, filtering specific videos based on criteria, and handling missing or incomplete video information efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**numpy**: Provides fundamental numerical computing capabilities. It powers the mathematical operations needed to calculate video statistics, analyze trends in view counts, and process arrays of numerical data like engagement metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### YouTube-Specific Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**isodate**: Specialized library for working with YouTube's duration format. It converts the platform's unique time format (like PT15M33S for 15 minutes, 33 seconds) into standard Python time objects, enabling analysis of video length patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ast**: Safely converts string representations of Python objects into actual usable objects. This is particularly useful when YouTube API returns complex data structures (like tags or metadata) as text strings that need to be transformed into workable formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**TextBlob**: Natural language processing toolkit that enables understanding of video titles, descriptions, and comments. It provides sentiment analysis to gauge emotional tone, identifies key phrases, and performs grammatical analysis - crucial for understanding viewer engagement and content themes."

Additionally, performing an inner join automatically reduces the dataset size by including only matching records, which optimizes resource usage. The final DataFrame is structured to retain the original comment data, the corresponding video IDs, and channel titles, making it easier to group and analyze the data by channel or video for further exploration."

Moderate levels of nulls were found in `description` (394 missing, 3%) and `likeCount` (23 missing, 0.2%). After the initial cleaning, notable improvements included the complete resolution of nulls in `viewCount` (from 3 to 0), a substantial reduction in `commentCount` nulls (from 150 to 9), and full imputation of the `caption` field (from 13,246 to 0 nulls).

    "The handling of missing values and data types was carefully implemented to support reliable downstream analysis. For the description field, any missing values were filled with empty strings, ensuring a consistent text column format and preventing errors during NLP processing, while also retaining all video records without row deletion. Tag information was parsed using a robust `safe_literal_eval` function, which safely converts stringified lists to Python lists and manages null or malformed data, returning empty lists in problematic cases; this approach preserves data structure integrity and enables accurate tag analysis and vectorisation. For count-based engagement metrics, missing values were imputed with zeros, matching YouTube‚Äôs API convention for private or removed content, which ensures that all records are preserved, maintains numerical consistency for aggregation, and provides computational efficiency."

    "For machine learning applications, all features now have complete values with no nulls and consistent data types, allowing for proper feature extraction and ensuring that zero-filled counts do not distort statistical analysis. From a business analysis perspective, the approach maintains the full dataset size without losing records, uses empty strings and lists to clearly represent missing data, and aligns with YouTube‚Äôs platform conventions. Regarding maintenance, defensive programming strategies are used to prevent future errors, the imputation strategy is clearly documented in the code, and the handling rules can be easily modified as needed. The key strengths of this solution include systematic handling of all null cases to ensure completeness, context-aware selection of fill values for each field type, the inclusion of validation checks for verifiability, and scalability to larger datasets."

    "The correlation between views and comments is 0.62, indicating a moderately strong relationship. This means that, in general, videos with more views tend to receive more comments. However, the relationship is not perfectly linear‚Äîafter a certain point, the number of comments doesn't increase as rapidly as views do. This suggests that while higher viewership does encourage more discussion, audience interaction may start to level off for very popular videos."

    "This notebook successfully standardised formats, addressed missing values and malformed entries, and refined content by filtering irrelevant channels and preparing comments for NLP analysis. Through feature engineering, key analytical metrics such as engagement ratios and sentiment scores were created, and temporal posting patterns were extracted. Rigorous quality checks ensured no missing values remained, high view-comment correlation was verified, and leading channels like Jordan Peterson were identified. The resulting dataset provides reliable metrics, actionable insights, and ML-ready features, forming a robust foundation for meaningful exploratory analysis with a continued focus on Red Pill themes."
